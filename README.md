## Data Availability
The data of this study are publicly available at ().

All analyses were proerfomed using the available toolboxes: MATLAB R2022a ([https://www.mathworks.com](https://www.mathworks.com)), FreeSurfer Version 7.1.1 for Resampling ([http://freesurfer.net](http://freesurfer.net)), SimNIBS for Segmentation ([https://simnibs.github.io/simnibs/build/html/index.html](https://simnibs.github.io/simnibs/build/html/index.html)), ROAST for FEM ([https://www.parralab.org/roast/](https://www.parralab.org/roast/)), and SPM12 for Image Registration ([https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/)).

Statistical Analyses and Source Data

For transparency and in order to reconstruct/replicate our results, we upload the MATLAB script (Analysis.m) to analyze the data we used within our manuscript (SourceData.mat). The data file contains the source data (data), class labels (label), and pretrained weights (weights). 

To run the MATLAB script:
- Install MATLAB ([https://www.mathworks.com](https://www.mathworks.com))
- Clone the current repository to your working directory
- Change Directories to the cloned directory
- Run the Script
